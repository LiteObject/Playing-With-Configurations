# Playing with Configurations
## Application configuration in ASP.NET Core is performed using one or more configuration providers. 
Configuration providers read configuration data from key-value pairs using a variety of configuration sources:
* Settings files, such as appsettings.json
* Environment variables
* Azure Key Vault
* Azure App Configuration
* Command-line arguments
* Custom providers, installed or created
* Directory files
* In-memory .NET objects
